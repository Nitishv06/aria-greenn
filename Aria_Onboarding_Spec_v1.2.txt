ARIA ONBOARDING SURVEY (v1.2)

Overview:
The onboarding survey personalizes each user’s experience and generates early behavioral data for Aria. It outputs three key insights:
1. Archetype (Individual Contributor or Manager)
2. Motivational Profile
3. Stress Pattern

Survey Structure:
- 10 multiple-choice questions (A–D), one per screen (mobile-first)
- Starts with a "voice preference" screen to determine tone (clinical, plain, relational, metaphorical, or spiritual)
- Includes a branching question: “Do you lead others?” to assign archetype group (IC or Manager)

Outputs:
- Motivational Profile (e.g., Builder, Belonger, Seeker, etc.)
- Stress Pattern (e.g., Firefighter, Pleaser, Fortress, etc.)
- Archetype (IC or Manager group)

Archetype Groups:
Individual Contributors (IC): The Executor, The Analyst, The Connector, The Initiator, The Craftsman, The Adapter, The Seeker, The Anchor
Managers: The Stabilizer, The Visionary, The Harmonizer, The Challenger, The Caregiver, The Explorer, The Driver, The Strategist, The Coach, The Architect, The Orchestrator, The Builder

Data Model:
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "voice_pref": "clinical|plain|relational|metaphor|spiritual",
  "role": "IC|Manager",
  "responses": [...],
  "derived": {
    "motivational_profile": {"label": "", "confidence": 0.0},
    "stress_pattern": {"label": "", "confidence": 0.0},
    "archetype": {"group": "IC|Manager", "label": "", "confidence": 0.0}
  },
  "consent": {"share_with_manager": false},
  "timestamps": {"completed_at": "ISO-8601"}
}

Implementation Notes:
- Logic and weights stored in a configurable JSON/YAML file (no redeploy needed for adjustments).
- Results stored locally and anonymized for backend analytics.
- Archetype derived using the same axis-based logic as motivational and stress profiles.
- Clear separation between IC and Manager archetypes.
- Front-end flow: voice_pref → role question → 10 Qs → summary output.

Acceptance Criteria:
- End-to-end quiz runs smoothly on mobile web/app.
- Users see archetype + motivational + stress pattern summary.
- No individual visibility to managers (only aggregate insights shown).

Security:
- GDPR compliant; k-anonymity threshold ≥ 7 for org-level data.
- Users can delete data or revoke consent anytime.
